2 ways to include data in your application

1.get data from an API and copy it into a blank file with a JSON extension, then use the BUNDLE class(which is already included in swift) to access the data from the source files

2.To Query the API directly (URLSession instead of BUNDLE)

The data from an API is not in a swift readable format so we must use Decodable in order to use the data

TRY
If you see try? or try! then that just means I dont care about the error I just want the result of the function. AND you dont need a do catch
they always go in the beginning to catch an error
